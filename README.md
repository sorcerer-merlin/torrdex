# TorrDex
Semi-Private BitTorrent Indexing Community

What is TorrDex?

TorrDex is designed and maintained by Sorcerer Merlin and MediEvil Ages INC. It is intended to be a full-featured private BitTorrent P2P community written in PHP, MySQL and JavaScript. This project was originally started as a learning experience with the intent of better learning the in's and out's of the modernized file sharing community. It has since grown into a full-blown website that indexes torrents to a close nit group of friends. TorrDex sits on top of a basic LAMP stack served by Ubuntu Server 14.04.1 LTS.
