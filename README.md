# TorrDex

Check out the [TorrDex Wiki](https://github.com/sorcerer-merlin/torrdex/wiki/) for [screenshots](https://github.com/sorcerer-merlin/torrdex/wiki/Screenshots) and other useful information!

## What is TorrDex?

In short, TorrDex is a Semi-Private BitTorrent Indexing Community. It is licensed under the [GNU GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0-standalone.html), and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/sorcerer-merlin/torrdex) by its creator [Sorcerer Merlin](https://github.com/sorcerer-merlin/). TorrDex is NOT a main-stream entry-level web application developed by a team of dedicated programmers. It is a hobby-project developed by ONE intermediate-level+â„¢ hobbyist programmer. It is therefore subject to bugs and other issues, which should be reported at the repository [Issues](https://github.com/sorcerer-merlin/torrdex/issues) page. Any feature requests and the like can also be submitted there as well.

## Technical Specs

TorrDex is built using [HTML5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5), [PHP5](http://php.net/), [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/), [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) , and [AJAX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29). Account passwords are encrypted, using the [PasswordHash](https://github.com/defuse/password-hashing) class for PHP developed by [Taylor Hornby](https://github.com/defuse). BitTorrent processing and support is provided by the [PHP_BitTorrent](https://github.com/christeredvartsen/php-bittorrent) library (in PHAR format) developed by [Christer Edvartsen](https://github.com/christeredvartsen). The entire color scheme and theme for TorrDex is completely dynamic and achieved using [CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) and [Web Fonts](http://www.cssfontstack.com/Web-Fonts) (which MAY allow for additional theming support in the future!). TorrDex also makes use of the [Parsedown](https://github.com/erusev/parsedown) library for PHP developed by [Emanuil Rusev](https://github.com/erusev) to implement [MarkDown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) support for Torrent Descriptions. TorrDex also uses CAPTCHA-style verification codes, provided by the [simple-php-captcha](https://github.com/claviska/simple-php-captcha) script developed by [Cory LaViska](https://github.com/claviska).
